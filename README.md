# Maze Solver
Maze Solver using BFS | Python, Curses

A Python program that uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path through a maze. The maze is displayed in the terminal using the curses library, with real-time path visualization. The start position is marked with "O", and the end is marked with "X". The algorithm explores the maze, avoiding walls ("#") and searching for the exit, with the path highlighted in red.
